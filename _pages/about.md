I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), under supervision of [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/), from Sep 2022 to Mar 2026. Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree in 2022 from the school of Software and BNRist, [Tsinghua University](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under supervision of [Prof. Xuan Ding](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculty/dingxuan.htm) and [Prof. Zheng Yang](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yangzheng/) in the research group of [Prof. Yunhao Liu](https://people.gix.tsinghua.edu.cn/yunhao/). I was also very fortunate to work with [Prof. Chunhui Duan](https://duanch.github.io).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
