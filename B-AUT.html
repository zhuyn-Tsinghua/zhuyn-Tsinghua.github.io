      <p class="STYLE1">Today, RFID 
        tag authentication is critical but still challenging because of counterfeiting 
        attacks. Prior works leverage the unique 
        signal features incurred by tags' manufacture imperfection as fingerprints to authenticate single tag. Nevertheless, they 
        fail to realize the batch authentication of large-scale tags and
        pinpoint the counterfeit tags in physical space, which are vital
        for large-scale RFID applications (e.g., warehouse inventory).</p>
      <p><span class="STYLE1">This paper presents the generic architecture for batch tag 
        authentication called <span class="STYLE2">B-AUT</span> to <span class="STYLE3">simultaneously authenticate
      large-scale tags (<a>&ge;</a> 100 tags) and pinpoint the counterfeit tags in physical space</span>,
      which is fully compatible with EPC-global Gen2 standard and applicable to different signal features extracted by different RF devices without any hardware or firmware modifications. To verify the performance of <em>B-AUT</em> in extreme cases, we implement an example
      prototype on B-AUT with the most ordinary commodity RFID device (i.e., one RFID reader with single antenna), where
      phase shift is leveraged as the simplest fingerprint.
      Experiment results show that it can achieve the pinpointing
      accuracy of up to 92% when the counterfeiting attack is slight. In addition,
      we specify that the minimal theoretical upper bound of the number of counterfeit tags with same EPC is 13, regardless
      of the total tags' number</span>.</p>

    <p align="left" class="STYLE1">The evaluation metrics include the average pinpointing accuracy (APA), FAR, FRR and average time overhead (ATO). Please note that the test examples are on the basis of the most ordinary 
      commodity RFID device (i.e., one RFID reader with single
      antenna), where phase shift is leveraged as the simplest fingerprint
      and the utilized methods including clustering, genuineness validation and localization in B-AUT are very crude and cost-efficient <span class="STYLE4">(because we want to verify the performance of <em>B-AUT</em> in extreme cases)</span>.  So the results reflect the worst performance
      of built system on B-AUT, that is, utilizing stronger
      RFID devices, superior type of fingerprints and well-refined
      methods will promote the performance to a very large degree.</p>
    <p align="left" class="STYLE1">1. The Impact of Different Scenarios (<em>K</em>, <em>U</em>): <em>U</em> denoted by <em>x</em>&#215;<em>y</em> means <em>y</em> groups counterfeit tags and each gourp containing <em>x</em> counterfeit tags with duplicate EPC. The difference between APA(1<sup>st</sup>) and APA(after 2<sup>nd</sup>) is that goods are registered
    at the entrance of warehouse in the first round of authentication, while due to update mechanism in B-AUT the registered fingerprints are updated after the second round of authentication, thereby the APA(after 2<sup>nd</sup>) is much higher. From the Table below, we can find that APA, FAR and FRR all degrade (e.g., APA from 92.5% to 63.5%) with the increasing number of counterfeit tags, but fortunately the tendency of degradation is convergent. The variance of <em>U</em> makes a greater influence on APA than that of <em>K</em>. In addtion, the Figure shows the approximately linear growth of ATO with increasing number of tags, thereby verifying that B-AUT is applicable to large-scale RFID systems for batch authentication. </p>

    <p align="left" class="STYLE1">2. The Impact of Different Tag Models: We further test five different tag models from three leading providers (i.e., Alien, Impinj and NXP) to verify the performance of <em>B-AUT</em>. The results show that both chip model and antenna model will determine the pinpointing accuracy and to a certain extent <em>B-AUT</em> is effectiveness and applicable to all tag models. The hardware differences between tags from Impinj company are small and those from Alien company are relatively bigger. This conclusion can help user choose appropriate tag models in different applications. For example, critical applications requiring high security are recommended to use tags from Alien company and some wireless sensing applications requiring small hardware differences of tags are recommended to use tags from Impinj company. </p>

    <p align="left" class="STYLE1">3. The Impact of Different Parameters <em>&#948;</em>, <em>&#968;</em>, <em>error, f</em>: From the Figures below, we can draw following conclusions: Firstly, bigger <em>&#948;</em> corresponded to more coarse-grained clustering mainly leads to higher FAR and thus lower APA. Secondly, smaller <em>&#968;</em> corresponded to  tighter similarity matching will cause higher FRR and APA, however unfortunately bigger <em>&#968;</em> corresponded to looser similarity matching will cause higher FAR and also APA. Therefore, the value of <em>&#968;</em> requires well-refined tradeoff. Thirdly, bigger <em>error</em> corresponded to larger searching space of dubious tags is preferred so that the APA can be improved, while ATO will increase likewise. So trading off value of<em> error</em> is similarly important. Fourthly, we can find that B-AUT is resistant to different communication channels.</p>
